## because 0xMUSSAR was invalid

Hey! My name's Joshua, but you can call me Mussar. I was a professional musician and sound designer for over ten years (check me out on your favorite streaming platform! check out my sample packs on splice!), and now I work as an Application Security Engineer.

I write a lot of Python and Go, but I'm still settling on a systems level language to add to my toolkit. Nushell is my daily driver for working in a shell terminal, and yes, I use Neovim (BTW).

In my spare time, I write music (duh), work on side projects with my fianc√©e, and look for new things to learn.
